Humboldt is a server that, in conjunction with other instances of
Humboldt, creates and maintains a secure and scalable overlay
network.  The Humboldt server itself is responsible for maintaining
the overlay network, even on restart, and builds routing tables to
facilitate unicast, anycast, multicast, and broadcast services.
Humboldt clients can connect to the Humboldt server to use any of
these services.

Early Development
=================

Note that Humboldt is in early development, and the primary
functionality described above is not available at the time of this
writing.  This is likely to change rapidly, so check back often.
Contributions are welcome.  Note that Humboldt is licensed under the
Apache License, Version 2.0.
